    description: `
On 16 December 2012, a 23-year-old woman was brutally gang-raped and assaulted inside a private bus in Delhi. 
She and her friend were thrown out onto the road in critical condition. She later died from her injuries, 
leading to nationwide protests. The case forced the Government to form the Justice Verma Committee, 
which recommended major criminal law reforms.

Four adult accused were awarded the death penalty, the juvenile was given 3 years detention, 
and another accused died in jail. This case led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013, 
making laws on sexual assault more strict.

The Supreme Court introduced the Basic Structure Doctrine, stating that Parliament can amend the Constitution 
but cannot change its basic structure. This judgment protected the democratic framework, judicial independence, 
and citizens’ fundamental rights.

    description: `
Shah Bano, a 62-year-old Muslim woman, was divorced by her husband. She requested maintenance 
under Section 125 of the CrPC, a secular law applicable to all religions. Her husband argued 
that Muslim personal law does not require him to pay maintenance.

The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shah Bano, stating that Muslim women are also entitled to 
maintenance under CrPC. The judgment caused political controversy, leading to the Muslim Women 
(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.

“Right to Life and Personal Liberty” includes fairness, justice, and non-arbitrariness.
